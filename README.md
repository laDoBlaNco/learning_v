# learning_v

My path learning the V programming language. Language is ver interesting to me and although
It will probably not be my replacementvsystems language , at least not for now, I do do believe 
that it will compliment my passion for Go.

## My Goals
My goals with this project is really just to learn v and see if I can start to use it
as a possible goto systems hacking language. I love Go and TinyGo, and starting to love Odin
as well. V claims to be a Go replacement, but there are specific diffs that you have to appreciate in V. There are a lot of claims about what fields are covered by V. I want to give it a try
and see for myself. It feels like what Red is trying to do with Robol, but in this case its
V and Go.

Though I'm just going through the demo and the examples, I'm also adding in my thoughts to
the already great comments which helps me reason and understand about the language semantics.
